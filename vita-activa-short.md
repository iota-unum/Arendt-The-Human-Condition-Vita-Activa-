## The Human Condition by Hannah Arendt

### What Does It Mean to Be Human?

Arendt argues that being human isn't about some fixed essence or nature, but rather about **how we spend our lives in the world**. She calls this the "human condition" and breaks it down into three main activities: **labor, work, and action**.

**Labor** is the most basic, connected to the biological process of our bodies. It's the realm of the **animal laborans**, the animal who works to live and live to work. Arendt argues that modern society has become a "society of laborers," leading to **world alienation** – we're so absorbed in biological necessities that we forget about the broader world and our ability to make it meaningful.

**Work** is about creating the world around us, the artificial world of objects that separate us from nature. It's the realm of **homo faber**, the maker, the builder, the artisan. Work requires effort, but it also creates things that endure, that have a kind of **durability**.

**Action** is about being in the world with others, not through things, but through **plurality**. It's about making a difference, starting something new (**natality**), and engaging in the **space of appearance**, the public realm where we reveal who we are through our words and deeds.

### Public and Private

Arendt argues that the distinction between public and private has become blurred with the **rise of the social**. This new "society" is neither truly public nor private. It's a giant household where people are pushed into a state of mind where they're just **laboring animals** who need to consume.

This "society" doesn't really respect **private property** the way older societies did. It's more about **wealth** – the accumulation of money – than preserving a stable world.

**Intimacy** is a reaction against society's pressure to conform. It's a way for people to find a refuge where their unique individuality can shine through.

### Division of Labor

Throughout classical antiquity, the ancient Greeks saw labor with contempt, believing it was inherently slavish. They valued the production of great works that transcended the individual life-span.

In the modern age, labor was elevated, with economists like Adam Smith and Karl Marx seeing it as a source of wealth. But Arendt argues they conflated labor with **work**, ignoring the distinction between **productive labor** (building a house) and **unproductive labor** (menial tasks).

Marx focused on the **life process** of society and missed the importance of the things labor produces in shaping a **world** that transcends the individual life.

Arendt distinguishes between the **instruments of work** (designed to produce lasting value) and the **instruments of labor** (for easing the burden of staying alive). The division of labor makes men behave like machines, their work becoming repetitive.

### Work

**Work** is about building the world around us, creating things that go beyond our individual lives. It involves **reification** – turning something intangible into a tangible thing.

The process of making things is driven by **instrumentality**, using means to achieve ends. But this can trap us in an endless chain of means and ends, making the world feel meaningless.

For homo faber, the **exchange market** is the public realm where he can showcase his creations and receive recognition for his work. But this process of exchange can lead to the devaluation of things, reducing them to mere commodities.

### Action

**Action** is what Arendt thinks is most distinctively human. When we act, we reveal who we are – our unique, irreplaceable selves – through our **speech** and **deeds**.

Action isn't isolated; it's inserting ourselves into a web of relationships with others, creating a kind of **life story** that unfolds as we interact.

**Power** keeps the **space of appearance** (the public realm) alive. It exists only when people are acting together, speaking and making decisions.

The Greeks created the **polis** (city-state) to provide a space where people could **share words and deeds** and achieve **immortality** through the deeds and stories that would outlive them.

But human affairs are **fragile**. We never fully know what we're doing when we act, and our actions can set in motion consequences we can't control.

Arendt suggests two ways to deal with this: the power to **forgive** (undoing what we've done) and the power of **promise** (creating stability and trust through the agreements we make).

### The Modern Age

Arendt sees the Modern Age as a time of **World Alienation**. We're both getting further away from the earth, physically and intellectually, and more stuck in the hamster wheel of our own lives, consumed by the need for stuff and security.

The **Archimedean Point** – looking at the earth from a position outside of it – brought about a revolution in science, shifting from studying the earth to studying the universe (**Universal Science**).

This shift, combined with **Cartesian Doubt** (our senses can't be trusted), led to **Introspection**, focusing on the processes of the mind rather than the world outside.

The Modern Age witnessed the **Victory of Homo Faber**, the maker of things, the builder of the world. We became obsessed with "making" things, with applying our knowledge to build a better world.

But it also saw the rise of the **Principle of Happiness**, where life became more comfortable and easier, and we became focused on our own comfort and happiness.

This led to the **Victory of the Animal Laborans**, where we became obsessed with producing and consuming, keeping the biological process of life going as efficiently as possible.

So, the Modern Age is a paradox: a time of incredible progress and innovation, but also a time when we're losing touch with the world and with ourselves.
